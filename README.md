#CS 50 Finance 

My first attempt at a production app as well as my first attempt 
at implementing OOP in python. Hoping to eventually implement an
improved UX over what is present here: https://finance.cs50.net/login

implemented improvements:
        -the ability to view quotes and requote on the same page

intended improvements:
        -users will be able to create separate portfolios
        -users will be able to track portfolio or individual investment performance
